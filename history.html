                <h1>Newgrange's History</h1>
                <p>
                    Newgrange was constructed c. 3200 BCE, pre-dating the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and is part of
                    one of the most famous and significant megalithic complexes in Europe. There are 37 tombs located in
                    the valley of Bru na Boinne (Mansion of the Boyne), which lies at a bend in the River Boyne and includes
                    two other enormous structures similar to Newgrange: Knowth and Dowth.

                        The monument is 249 feet (76 metres) across and 39 feet (12 metres) high, covering an acre of ground
                        (4500 square metres). The entrance leads to a 62 foot (19 metres) passage, which opens to a central chamber
                        with three recesses (sometimes also called 'chambers') in the walls at intervals corresponding to
                        north, west, and south.

                        The Newgrange Entrance Stone is the masterpiece of the neolithic passage-grave builders it's art
                        is the most recognisable symbol of prehistory in Ireland. The decoration consists of a large
                        triple spiral engraved with double loops. The box over the entrance is aligned there to send
                        light into the passage tomb on the winter solstice every year showing the builders studied
                        astronomy.

                <h2>Building of the Newgrange</h2>
                <p>
                    There was an older structure on the site prior to this time, which was dismantled and its stones
                    used in the early stages of Newgrange's construction. Of the four types of megalithic tombs as 
                    defined by archaeologists the court tomb, portaltomb, passage tomb, and wedge tomb - only passage 
                    tombs were built at Bru na Boinne. to those who built portal and court tombs. This tradition developed 
                    first along the western coastline of Europe, particularly the Iberian peninsula and Brittany, before 
                    spreading to Britain and Ireland. This is especially interesting because the Celts are thought to have 
                    first arrived in Ireland from the Iberian peninsula as late as 500-300 BCE, long after Newgrange was built. 
                    A stable community must have existed in the region to have created these massive structures. They would have 
                    been skilled stone masons with considerable wealth in order to spare the time from making a living to devote 
                    to raising the great tombs and monuments.

                            Remarkably, huge amounts were carried vast distances to the building site at Newgrange. The
                            majority of structural stones in the Boyne Valley tombs are greywacke. This stone type was
                            quarried in the Clogherhead area, north of Drogheda Co Louth. Other granite boulders used in
                            the structure were collected from the North shore of Dundalk Bay. The entire mound contains 
                            an estimated 200,000 tonnes of material, and it has been estimated construction would have 
                            taken about 30 years using a workforce of about 300.

                            The facade at Newgrange consists of white quartz, which has its origins in the Wicklow
                            Mountains. The long distances suggest that stone was carried by ship along the sea and the
                            up into the river Boyne whose bank is located one kilometer from Newgrange. In order to get
                            the stone up the 1km distance uphill from the river Boyne, it is most likely that the
                            Neolithic people used the transportation technique of logrolling. Wooden scaffolding and
                            earthen ramps would have been used to lift and put the stones in place.

            <h2>Modern History</h2>
            <p>
                The modern history of Newgrange begins on August 14th 1699 when Charles Campbell took out a 99 year
                lease on the lands around Newgrange. Campbell was one of the new landowners who appeared after the Battle 
                of the Boyne in 1690. Quarrying stone from the giant mound to build roads, his workmen uncovered the decorated
                Entrance Stone, then found the entrance to the passage and chamber. In 1699 Edward Lhuyd who worked for
                the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, surveyed Newgrange for it's first time. Professor Michael J. O'Kelly began
                work at Newgrange in 1962 and excavated every summer for a season of 4 months until 1975, and his work gives
                us the Newgrange we see today. There has been quite a bit of controversy and debate, in particular about both
                the reconstruction of the roof-box and the white wall of quartz, and it is highly unlikely that Newgrange
                ever would have looked as it currently appears.
