    <h1>
        A Brief History of Newgrange
    </h1>
    <p>Newgrange was constructed around 3200 BC, pre-dating the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and is part of one of
        the most famous and
        significant megalithic complexes in Europe. Making it one of the ancient wonders of the world. Newgrange was
        built in the Stone Age
        before any metals were available, it is a type of tomb known as a passage-grave Neolithic monument located in
        the region of Bru na
        Boinne, County Meath, Ireland. This type of passage tombs are seen across mush of western Europe and it is
        thought that Newgrange
        was built by the Celts who also built tombs in a similar way.</p>
