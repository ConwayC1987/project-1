            A Brief History of Newgrange
        </h1>
        <p>Newgrange was constructed around 3200 BC, pre-dating the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and is part of one
            of
            the most famous and
            significant megalithic complexes in Europe. Making it one of the ancient wonders of the world. Newgrange was
            built in the Stone Age
            before any metals were available, it is a type of tomb known as a passage-grave Neolithic monument located
            in
            the region of Bru na
            Boinne, County Meath, Ireland. This type of passage tombs are seen across mush of western Europe and it is
            thought that Newgrange
            was built by the Celts who also built tombs in a similar way.</p>
