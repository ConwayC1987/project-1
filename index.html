    <h1>
        A Brief History of Newgrange
    </h1>
    <p>Newgrange was constructed around 3200 BC, pre-dating the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and is part of one of the most famous and
       significant megalithic complexes in Europe. Making it one of the ancient wonders of the world. Newgrange was built in the Stone Age 
       before any metals were available, it is a type of tomb known as a passage-grave Neolithic monument located in the region of Bru na 
       Boinne, County Meath, Ireland. This type of passage tombs are seen across mush of western Europe and it is thought that Newgrange 
       was built by the Celts who also built tombs in a similar way.</p>
