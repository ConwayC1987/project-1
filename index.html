        <h1>Brief Description and History of Newgrange</h1>
        <p>Newgrange is aligned on the winter solstice sunrise and every year a beam of sun stretches a beam of light
            penetrates the roof-box and travels up the 19 meter passage and into the chamber. As the sun rises higher,
            the beam widens so that the whole chamber is dramatically illuminated. It is the main monument in the Brú na
            Bóinne complex,
            a World Heritage Site that also includes the passage tombs of Knowth and Dowth,
            burial mounds and standing stones. Newgrange consists of a large circular mound with an inner stone
            passageway and
            cruciform chamber. Burnt and unburnt human bones, and possible grave goods or votive offerings, were found
            in
            this chamber. Newgrange was constructed around 3200 BC, pre-dating the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and
            is part
            of one of the most famous and significant megalithic complexes in Europe. Making it one of the ancient
            wonders of the
            world. Newgrange was built in the Stone Age before any metals were available, it is a type of tomb known as
            a passage-grave.
            This type of passage tombs are seen across much of western Europe and it is thought that Newgrange was built
            by the Celts who also built tombs in a similar way.</p>
